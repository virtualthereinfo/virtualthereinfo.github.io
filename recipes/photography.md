## notes  
*  For East-facing properties, morning is the best time to shoot
*  For West-facing properties, the afternoon is great
*  For North-facing properties, any time between 10:00 and 14:00 is ideal
*  For South-facing properties, youâ€™ll want your photos taken first thing in the morning or last thing in the day
